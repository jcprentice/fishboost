# Meeting 15 Aug

## Expt 1
Try with fewer 1e6 samples
Try with only 1 trial
Widen the LP prior, narrow on shape

Stick Trial FE on Det

## Expt 2
Expand simple model
- simulate separate trials
- no genetics
- Donor LIDR / I[LDR] / linked but incorrectly

## Expt 3
Test max model
- simulate separate trials
- genetics slidr [] / slidr [ldr]
- donor lid

## Expt 4
Investigate correlations



# Meeting 17 Aug

For next time check trace plots

Try fixing LP and doing a SA

1. Try make FEs larger
2. Rerun FB1 and FB2 with donor FEs fixing LP

do 1, 2, 1+2

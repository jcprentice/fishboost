# Fishboost data ----
#
# Convert the fishboost data from XLSX to a format usable here. The final result
# is the "fb_data" data table.
#
# For simulations purposes, we need "id" and "group" for the epidemic, and
# "sire" and "dam" for generating pedigree and trait values.
#
# If just using directly with SIRE 2.0, we need the "Tinf" and "Trec" values.
# There should be two ways of obtaining these, so we get both to check
# consistency.
#
# Note that we only know the time individuals become infectious, if there is a
# latent incubation period, then we are dealing with an SEIR model, and so we
# actually know "Tsym", not "Tinf". We'll assume these are the same unless we
# know better (e.g. "donor" individuals that show symptoms several days after
# the experiment begins should have Tinf = 0).
#
# I have been using R's data.table package for performance reasons, but this can
# be easily converted into a data frame or a tibble if preferred.
